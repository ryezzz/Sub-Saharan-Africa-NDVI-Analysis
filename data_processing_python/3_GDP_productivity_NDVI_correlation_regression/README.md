## 3. Correlation analysis with GEE data and Worldbank Data

I ran this [basic correlation analysis](https://github.com/ryezzz/Sub-Saharan-Africa-NDVI-Analysis/blob/master/data_processing_python/GDP_productivity_NDVI_correlation_regression/simple_NDVI_regression_correlation.ipynb) which ended up having really interesting results: High correlation between NDVI and GDP as well as NDVI and Productivity, while GDP and Productivity had low correlation. When running a regressing analysis, however, everything has statistically significant relationships, implying that all variables are interrelated despite low correlation.
