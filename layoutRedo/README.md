Vegetation indices derived from satellite flyover data tend to correlate with GDP, particularly in agrarian economies. [This analysis](https://ryezzz.github.io/data_viz_thesis/thesis_versions/presentation1/) explores the linkages between agricultural policymaking, land usage patterns/vegetation shifts, and economic output in sub-Saharan Africa. By aggregating thousands of sequential satellite measurements taken by Landsat 5, 7, and 8 between 1990 and present-day, this study constructs a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using Google Earth Engine servers. Agricultural classification and geospatial masking are specified by the author.
